# Automated-Predictive-Maintenance

### **Overview**  
This project implements an **Automated Predictive Maintenance** system leveraging **Machine Learning (ML) and IoT sensor data** to detect potential failures before they happen. By analyzing sensor readings, the model predicts **equipment anomalies and failures**, reducing downtime and optimizing maintenance schedules.  

### **Key Features**  
✅ **Data Ingestion & Preprocessing** – Extracts real-time IoT sensor data and processes it for analysis.  
✅ **Feature Engineering** – Extracts meaningful insights from sensor readings.  
✅ **ML Model Training & Evaluation** – Uses advanced machine learning models for predictive maintenance.  
✅ **Automated Pipeline** – End-to-end workflow from data collection to prediction using **MLOps** principles.  
✅ **Visualization & Reporting** – Generates actionable insights for maintenance teams.  

### **Tech Stack**  
 **Python** – Data processing & model training  
 **AWS / Cloud Services** – Scalable deployment (if applicable)  
 **ML Frameworks** – Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch (depending on implementation)  
  **SQL / NoSQL Databases** – Data storage & retrieval  

### **Dataset: METROP3**

This project utilizes the METROP3 dataset, which consists of IoT sensor readings from industrial equipment. The dataset contains time-series data on temperature, vibration, pressure, and other key indicators used to predict failures. Ensure you have access to the dataset before running the pipeline.

### **How It Works**  
1. **Collect sensor data**  from IoT-enabled devices.
2. **Preprocess & analyze**  data for trends & anomalies.
3. **Train ML models**  to predict failures based on historical patterns.
4. **Deploy & monitor** the system for real-time predictions.  

### **Use Cases**  
 **Manufacturing** – Detect machine failures before breakdowns.  
 **Energy & Utilities** – Monitor turbines, transformers, and grid components.  
 **Aviation & Automotive** – Predict maintenance needs in aircraft & vehicles.  
 **Healthcare Equipment** – Ensure reliability of critical medical devices.
